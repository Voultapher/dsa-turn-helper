### Example

A quick example of how this tool can be used to assist you in managing a fight
in DSA. First in the Party managing section, you'll want to create parties
appropriate to the fight. Note you can prepare this ahead of time, as it does
not require any fight specific information. Feel free to store and load this
with the 'Load' and 'Download' buttons.

Then once the parties are assembled click on 'New' in the turn simulation Area.
Changes you make now to the party section will only affect the turn simulation
once you click 'New' again.

Now that the simulation is set up properly, you'll notice it already sorted
the participants by their base initiative. Use this first round to update
their initiative to the value the players tell you, by simply entering the
value in the field marked with 'I:'. Should multiple participants have the
same initiative, feel free to differentiate them with non integer number,
like 16.1, which is more than just 16. You are already in the first turn
of the battle. The cursor on the left of the participants name shows you
who's turn it is currently. Play out the turn and adjust health and
initiative values as they change in turn 1. Then step into the next turn,
by clicking the button with the '>' symbol. Again play out the turn and
update the health and initiative values, in the fields marked with
'H:' and 'I:'. Repeat until the fight is over. You can go back any time
and see how the values and initiative order changed over the course of
turns and rounds.
